                            Humans (collectively referred to as mankind or humanity) are a resilient species native to the world of Azeroth. Recent discoveries have shown that humans are descended from the barbaric half-giant vrykul of Northrend. Early humans were primarily a scattered and tribal people for several millennia, until the rising strength of the troll empire forced their strategic unification. Thus the nation of Arathor was formed, along with its capital, the city-state of Strom.

                         Dwarves are an ancient bold and courageous race descended from the earthen.[1] The race is split into various different clans, with the three most predominant being led by the Council of Three Hammers. Ironforge dwarves hold the majority of the mountainous Khaz Modan region in the Eastern Kingdoms. The Wildhammer dwarves make their homes within Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands and around their former home of Grim Batol in the Twilight Highlands.

                                The gnomes (collectively referred to as gnomanity[1] or gnomekind)[2] are a race of diminutive and highly intelligent humanoids, known for their mastery of technology. They were originally descended from mechagnomes, metallic titan-forged, who were afflicted with the Curse of Flesh. The early gnomes eventually found their way to Khaz Modan, where they founded the capital of Gnomeregan and became allies with their nearby dwarven cousins.

                                    Night elves (or kaldorei, for "Children of the Stars" in Darnassian[2]), are a powerful and mystical race whose origins extend back to ancient times. These then-immortal beings were among the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before the First War.[3] The founders of a magical and advanced civilization which at its peak spanned the breadth of ancient Kalimdor, the night elves came into a horrific conflict with the Burning Legion but achieved a Pyrrhic victory that ended in the Great Sundering,

                                        The draenei [ˈdɹænɑɪ] (meaning Exiled Ones in their own tongue) are a faction of uncorrupted eredar who fled their homeworld of Argus to escape the corruption of the demonic Burning Legion. Led by the Prophet Velen and guided by the divine naaru, they traveled throughout the cosmos in search of a safe world to settle on, eventually landing on a planet they would come to call Draenor, or "Exiles' Refuge". For centuries, the draenei lived in relative peace with Draenor's native orcs, until agents of the Burning Legion found them. As the orcs were corrupted by the Legion and formed the original Horde

                                            Worgen [ˈwɔɹgɛn] are large, lupine humanoids that walk upright, but lope on all fours to run. They primarily inhabit forests and are natural hunters. Being bitten by or drinking the blood of a worgen causes humans and night elves to be transformed into one. After the transformation, those that are overcome by rage and guilt gradually lose all vestiges of their former lives and turn mindless. By controlling their emotions via medication, magic, and self-discipline, worgen may resist being overcome by their feral instincts
